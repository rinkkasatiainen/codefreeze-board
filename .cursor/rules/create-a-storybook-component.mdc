when creating a web component, follow these rules:

- take inspiration from [cfb-example.stories.js](mdc:storybook/stories/template/cfb-example.render.js) and the respective #cfb-example.render.js.
- separate the rendering part into own file (.render.js)

- Follow the following folder structure
 - always put stories in /stories folder
 - have a sub folder which is the name of the NPM module without the @rinkkasatiainen prefix
 - create 2 files, cfb-<module_name>.render.js and cfb-<module_name>.stories.js
