when creating a web component, follow these rules:

- just create a simple example web component, use from [cfb-example.js](mdc:cfb-npm-template/src/components/cfb-example.js).
- also create a respective test case, use from [cfb-example.test.js](mdc:cfb-npm-template/test/components/cfb-example.test.js).
- in the test case, add only test list, not test implementation. for rule 'write-a-test-list.mdc'. If the test case file exist, read it to understand what the component should do
- the important part for the web component are 'definedAttributes', 'elementName' from the example
- follow the naming convention of 'cfb-' for files and CfbExample for the component
- do not write the implementation for the component just yet - that will happen later.

- the component, when fetching data, by default needs to fetch that from IndexDB. Please check if the 
capability contains an indexDB client (typically in /ports folder) - and if it does, in the component, just do programming by wishful thinking, and use non-existing code. And write a TODO to implement that in the indexDb storage.
